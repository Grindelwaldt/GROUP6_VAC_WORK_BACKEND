# GROUP6_VAC_WORK_BACKEND

This is the repo for the backend of group 6's mobile laser tag web application.

The backend was built using as an express application using Node.js.

If you want to implement the system locally you would need to change the ip address defined in both lines 12 and 20 of the server.js file to the local ip address of the front end server. However the camera feed will only work on the computer that hosts the front end as both the server and the backend use http.

To run the application clone the repo and use node server.js in the terminal.
